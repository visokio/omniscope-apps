# omniscope-apps
## Collections of apps built on top of Omniscope APIs and documentation

Apart from being a complete BI data analytics tool, Omniscope is also an integration and extensible platform. 

A family of REST, JavaScript, Python and R APIs lets you:
- Trigger and parameterise workflows
- Schedule and orchestrate complex tasks
- Create projects programmatically from templates with parameters
- Query and transform report data
- Build your own custom data routine or visual components and mini-apps inside Omniscope

All APIs are documented and can be explored here: https://public.omniscope.me/_global_/api/
